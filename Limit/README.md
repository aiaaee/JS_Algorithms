## Limit Math

In mathematics, a limit is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the argument (or index) approaches some value.Limits of functions are essential to calculus and mathematical analysis, and are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.

Limits play a vital role in calculus and mathematical analysis and are used to define integrals, derivatives, and continuity. It is used in the analysis process, and it always concerns the behavior of the function at a particular point. The limit of a sequence is further generalized in the concept of the limit of a topological net and related to the limit and direct limit in the theory category. Generally, the integrals are classified into two types namely, definite and indefinite integrals. For definite integrals, the upper limit and lower limits are defined properly. Whereas indefinite integrals are expressed without limits, and it will have an arbitrary constant while integrating the function. Let us discuss the definition and representation of limits of the function, with properties and examples in detail.
