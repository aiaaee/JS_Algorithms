## Derivation In Mathematics 

In mathematics, a derivation is a function on an algebra that generalizes certain features of the derivative operator :

Derivative is one of the most important and widely used concepts in the world of mathematics. This concept is taught at the intermediate level along with other concepts such as limit and continuity. Derivatives of different functions have their own formulas. Understand the basics by bringing these formulas and memorizing the most important ones will help you solve many related problems in this field.


If (x(f = y) is an assumed function, the derivative of function f equals 
` f′(x) = lim ( f(x+h)−f(x) ) / h ) is limiting with  h→0 `



## Math.js 
in that project I want to use one of the best library for computing mathematics computation with Math.js .
### Description
Math.js is An extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.
it features a flexible expression parser with support for symbolic computation, comes with a large set of built-in functions and constants, and offers an integrated solution to work with different data types like numbers, big numbers, complex numbers, fractions, units, and matrices. Powerful and easy to use.
