## Derivation In Mathematics 

In mathematics, a derivation is a function on an algebra that generalizes certain features of the derivative operator :

Derivative is one of the most important and widely used concepts in the world of mathematics. This concept is taught at the intermediate level along with other concepts such as limit and continuity. Derivatives of different functions have their own formulas. Understand the basics by bringing these formulas and memorizing the most important ones will help you solve many related problems in this field.


If (x(f = y) is an assumed function, the derivative of function f equals 
` f′(x) = lim ( f(x+h)−f(x) ) / h ) is limiting with  h→0 `

you can read about it in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules)

## Math.js 
in that project I want to use one of the best library for computing mathematics computation with Math.js .
### Description
Math.js is An extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.
it features a flexible expression parser with support for symbolic computation, comes with a large set of built-in functions and constants, and offers an integrated solution to work with different data types like numbers, big numbers, complex numbers, fractions, units, and matrices. Powerful and easy to use.


### Features 
1. Supports numbers, big numbers, bigint, complex numbers, fractions, units, strings, arrays, and matrices.
2. Is compatible with JavaScript’s built-in Math library.
3. Contains a flexible expression parser.
4. Does symbolic computation.
5. Comes with a large set of built-in functions and constants.
6. Can be used as a command line application as well.
7. Runs on any JavaScript engine.
8. Is easily extensible.
9. Open source.


## Explanation 
1. __Derivative Function__ : The derivative function uses numerical differentiation to approximate the derivative at a given point using the limit definition.

2. __Count Variables Function__ : The count_variables function analyzes a string representation of a function to identify unique variable names. It splits the string based on mathematical operations and checks for valid identifiers.

3. __Example Usage__ (__Derivate example function__) :
   - We define a simple function example_function that represents \\( f(x) =  3*(Math.sin(x ** 2 )) / Math.cos(x) ).
   - We provide a string representation of this function to count_variables to determine how many unique variables it contains.
   - Finally, we calculate the derivative at \\( x = 2 \\) and print the result.

### output 
When you run this code, you should see output in [source]()
